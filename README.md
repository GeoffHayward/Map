Map - Work in progress
=======

A JavaScript object that can be instantiated with the new operator. This object is a JavaScript object that is a close version of the Java Map interface from the Java Collections framework.

The object's deviations from the Java Map are:

* entitySet - missing (use values)
* keySet - is named keys (it returns an array of unique values)
* hashCode - missing
